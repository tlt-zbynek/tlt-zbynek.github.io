          This site is intended to check basic support for a selected device.
          It will achieve this goal by iterating over all interfaces a device offers and trying to claim those interfaces.
          If at least one interface is claimable a web page can talk to the device via WebUSB.
          <br><br>
          <b>If no interfaces are claimable that doesn't mean that the device is not supported.</b>
          It might be used by another application or your user might not have access rights (Linux only).
          To grant access to a USB device on Linux a udev rule needs to be created.
          <br><br>
          The set of not supported devices include Webcams, HIDs and mass storage devices.
          Generally, every device that has a native driver handle is unaccessible for the browser.
          <br><br>
          All devices that have been connected are automatically tested again.
          <br><br>
          Check the developer tools console for potential errors.
